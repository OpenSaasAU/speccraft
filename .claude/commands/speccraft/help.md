## Claude Code Integration

This help system integrates seamlessly with Claude Code's implementation capabilities:

1. **Get Documentation**: Use `/speccraft:help <topic>` to understand concepts
2. **Implement Code**: Ask Claude Code to implement based on the guidance
3. **Iterate**: Use help to refine and enhance your implementation

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Feature
```
1. /speccraft:help user-owned          # Learn the pattern
2. "Create a user-owned Post schema"   # Ask Claude Code to implement
3. /speccraft:help hooks               # Add business logic
4. "Add audit trail to Post schema"   # Enhance implementation
```

### Enhancing Existing Code
```
1. /speccraft:help access-control      # Review security patterns
2. "Add role-based access to my schema" # Apply improvements
3. /speccraft:help list-view           # Optimize admin UI
```

### Debugging and Optimization
```
1. /speccraft:help validation          # Understand validation
2. /speccraft:help hooks               # Review hook usage
3. "Fix validation in my User schema"  # Apply fixes
```

## Tips

- **Be Specific**: Use exact field names or pattern names for best results
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic topics, then explore advanced concepts
- **Combine with Claude**: Use help for understanding, Claude Code for implementation
- **Iterate**: Reference help multiple times as your implementation evolves

Perfect for learning Keystone.js patterns and getting implementation guidance! ðŸ“š
